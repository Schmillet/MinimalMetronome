Metronome App created using Node.js, React Native, and Expo.

# Goal
The goal of this app is to create something I would use on a daily basis as a guitar player, and also sharpen my knowledge using JavaScript and React Native.
I built this app with IOS and the Expo Go app in mind, since I don't own a system with MacOS installed at the time of development.


# How to Build
- Node.js is required to build this app: [Download Link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current)
- Expo Audio is required: `npx expo install expo-av`
- To run app using Expo Go, enter `npx expo start` in the terminal
